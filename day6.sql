CREATE TABLE Students (

INSERT INTO Students VALUES

select * from students;

1. Simple GROUP BY

-- Count students in each department
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS StudentCount
FROM Students
GROUP BY Department;

-- Average marks in each department
SELECT Department, AVG(Marks) AS AvgMarks
FROM Students
GROUP BY Department;

-- Maximum marks in each department
SELECT Department, MAX(Marks) AS TopMarks
FROM Students
GROUP BY Department;

2. GROUP BY with Multiple Columns

-- Count by Department + Age
SELECT Department, Age, COUNT(*) AS StudentCount
FROM Students
GROUP BY Department, Age;

-- Sum of marks by Department + Age
SELECT Department, Age, SUM(Marks) AS TotalMarks
FROM Students
GROUP BY Department, Age;


3. Filtering Groups (HAVING)

ðŸ‘‰ WHERE filters rows before grouping.
ðŸ‘‰ HAVING filters groups after grouping.

-- Departments with more than 2 students
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS StudentCount
FROM Students
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;

-- Departments with average marks above 80
SELECT Department, AVG(Marks) AS AvgMarks
FROM Students
GROUP BY Department
HAVING AVG(Marks) > 80;

4. Combining WHERE + GROUP BY + HAVING

-- Only consider students age > 20, then group
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS StudentCount
FROM Students
WHERE Age > 20
GROUP BY Department;

-- Only groups with at least 2 students AND average marks > 75
SELECT Department, AVG(Marks) AS AvgMarks, COUNT(*) AS StudentCount
FROM Students
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2 AND AVG(Marks) > 75;

5. ORDER BY with GROUP BY

-- Show departments ordered by average marks
SELECT Department, AVG(Marks) AS AvgMarks
FROM Students
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY AvgMarks DESC;
